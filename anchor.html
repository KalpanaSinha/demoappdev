	<a name=Intro COLOR="BLUE"><b>Introduction</b></a><br><br>
	Pollution is the introduction of contaminants into
	the natural environment that cause adverse change.Pollution can take the form of chemical substances or
	energy, such as noise, heat or light. Pollutants, the components of pollution, can be either foreign
		substances/energies or naturally occurring contaminants. Pollution is often classed as point source
	or nonpoint source pollution.In 2015, pollution killed 9 million people in the world.</font></p>

<a name=Forms COLOR="BLUE"><b>Major Forms of Pollution</b></a><br>
<p>
	<ul>
	<li>Air pollution:  the release of chemicals and particulates into the atmosphere. Common gaseous pollutants
		include carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and nitrogen oxides produced by industry.</li>
	<li>Noise pollution:  which encompasses roadway noise, aircraft noise, industrial noise as well as high-intensity sonar.</li>
	<li>Thermal pollution, is a temperature change in natural water bodies caused by human influence,
		such as use of water as coolant in a power plant.</li>
	<li>Water pollution, by the discharge of wastewater from commercial and industrial waste
		into surface waters; discharges of untreated domestic sewage, and chemical contaminants.</li>
		<li>Soil contamination occurs when chemicals are released by spill or underground leakage. </li>
	</ul></p>

<a name=causes COLOR="green"><b>Sources & Causes</b></a><br>
<p>Air pollution comes from both natural and human-made (anthropogenic) sources. However, globally human-made
	pollutants from combustion, construction, mining, agriculture and warfare are increasingly significant in
	the air pollution equation.Principal stationary pollution sources include chemical plants, coal-fired power
	plants, oil refineries, petrochemical plants, nuclear waste disposal activity, incinerators, large
	livestock farms (dairy cows, pigs, poultry, etc.), PVC factories, metals production factories, plastics
	factories, and other heavy industry. Agricultural air pollution comes from contemporary practices which include
	clear felling and burning of natural vegetation as well as spraying of pesticides and herbicides.
